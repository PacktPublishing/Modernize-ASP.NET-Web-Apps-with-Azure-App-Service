## About the Video Course
Do you want to transform and modernize your legacy applications for the cloud? Azure App Service lets you quickly build, refactor, deploy, and scale enterprise-grade web apps running on any platform, without having to manage the infrastructure. You will take a typical legacy ASP.NET web application and transform it into a modern application with ASP.NET Core and Azure App Service as the main drivers of the change.
By the end of this course, you will have the skills to use Azure App Service to refactor, modernize, deploy, and highly scale your legacy applications.
